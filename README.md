## Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains my submission for a **Data Science Home Assignment**.  
It implements an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using **PyTorch** and **Streamlit**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on demographic and ticket-related features.  
The solution focuses on careful preprocessing of tabular data and a lightweight neural network architecture suitable for small datasets.
